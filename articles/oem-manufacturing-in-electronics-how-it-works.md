## What is OEM Manufacturing in Electronics?

Original equipment manufacturing in electronics refers to a business model where specialized factories produce components or complete devices based on another company's specifications. The finished products ship under the client's brand—you design it, they build it, you sell it.

According to IDC's Q3 2024 Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker, global PC shipments reached 68.8 million units, with contract manufacturers handling approximately 78% of total production volume. This outsourced electronics production model enables brands of all sizes to bring products to market without billion-dollar factory investments.

> **Pro Tip:** For a foundational understanding of OEM concepts, see our [complete guide to OEM manufacturing](/en/blog/what-is-oem-manufacturing-complete-explanation-b2b-buyers) which covers the basics for B2B buyers.

### How Electronics OEM Differs from Other Industries

Computer OEM production has unique characteristics that set it apart from general manufacturing:

| Aspect | Electronics OEM | General Manufacturing |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Component Complexity** | 200-500 parts per device | Often <50 parts |
| **Quality Standards** | CE, FCC, RoHS mandatory | Industry-dependent |
| **Lead Times** | 4-12 weeks typical | 2-8 weeks |
| **Defect Tolerance** | <0.5% AQL standard | Often 1-2% acceptable |
| **IP Sensitivity** | Critical (firmware, designs) | Moderate |

*Source: AIERXUAN internal analysis based on 500+ B2B projects, 2020-2024*

### Real-World Example: How a European Brand Launched in 90 Days

A German EdTech startup needed 2,000 custom-branded laptops for school deployment. Instead of building manufacturing capabilities, they partnered with an electronics manufacturing services provider.

**Project timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Specifications finalized, NDA signed
- Week 3-4: Component selection, sample approval
- Week 5-8: Mass production (2,147 units)
- Week 9: Shipping to Germany

**Result:** 23-day production cycle, 0.2% DOA rate, €47/unit cost savings vs. previous supplier.
